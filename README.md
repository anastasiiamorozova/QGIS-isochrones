# QGIS-isochrones

This project was created for Kordon.media, a regional media outlet in Sumy, Ukraine, where I come from.

During the war, having a shelter nearby is essential to stay alive, and city authorities are obliged to provide the population with equal access to safe places during air raid alarms. The purpose of the project is to show how authorities in Sumy failed to cope with this task.

The project was created in QGIS and Illustrator:
1. Using the Quick-OSM plugin in QGIS, I exported all the streets and waterways in the city.
2. Then, I downloaded addresses from the city website and geocoded them, adding them as a layer in QGIS.
3. Using the 'service area' tool in QGIS, I calculated the isochrones, marking all the streets from where one can reach the nearest shelter in 5 minutes.

The headline says: 
**Shelters nearby?
Mission: get to the closest shelter in 5 minutes**
